# Palindrome Checker

A simple web app to check whether a given word, phrase, or sentence is a **palindrome**.  
A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, spaces, and case.

This project was built as part of the **freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification**.

## 🚀 Features
- Input field to enter text.
- Checks for palindromes while ignoring:
  - Spaces
  - Punctuation
  - Case sensitivity
- Alerts if no input is provided.
- Displays result in a styled box.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML** – structure
- **CSS** – styling
- **JavaScript (ES6)** – palindrome logic

---

## 📖 How It Works
1. User enters text into the input field.
2. On clicking **Check**, the app:
   - Cleans the input by removing non-alphanumeric characters.
   - Converts text to lowercase.
   - Compares the cleaned text with its reversed version.
3. Displays whether the original input is a palindrome.

## 📋 Example Checks
- `A` → palindrome  
- `eye` → palindrome  
- `race car` → palindrom 
- `not a palindrome` → not a palindrome   
- `A man, a plan, a canal. Panama` → palindrome
